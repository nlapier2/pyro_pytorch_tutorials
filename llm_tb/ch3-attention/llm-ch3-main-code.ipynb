    "# LLM Textbook Chapter 3: Coding attention mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter covers how to code the (multi-head self-)attention mechanisms that form the core of modern transformers. It starts by building a basic self-attention mechanism in order to build intuition. It then moves on to causal/masked attention, where future words are masked during the training process. Then it moves on to full multi-head attention, which is used in transformers, and generalized causal attention to multiple heads which each learn different context vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the \"self\" in \"self-attention\" is used to distinguish it from the original attention mechanisms in encoder-decoder RNNs, where the decoder network learned to pay more attention to different inputs from the encoder network. Here attention is applied with respect to elements in the same vector, thus \"self\"."

    "The book chapter starts with a very basic form of attention which just involves dot products with fixed weights. I skip this part here. The key is that we have input tokens and we want to learn a \"context vector\" for each token which expresses the context the token is in relative to the others. This is ultimately the goal of the attention mechanism -- to learn contextually how tokens relate to each other, with some tokens paying more \"attention\" to specific other tokens based on context. In the basic example, this is computed by taking the dot product of each token and a pre-defined matrix, and summing those into a single context vector. We can define different weight matrices for different input tokens to obtain a different context vector for each input token."

These are \"query\", \"key\", and \"value\", whose weight matrices are denoted W_q, W_k, and W_v, respectively. These names come from the information retrieval literature. Each token has a learned \"query\" vector which is like a lookup query in a database. When looking up a query, we try to match it to the \"key\" of another token. If there is a match, then we retrieve the \"value\" associated with that query-key pair. In practice, we implement these as trainable matrices, as shown below."
